# Learning Webots ðŸ¤–

This repository contains a collection of Webots simulation projects as part of my journey into robotics and simulation using [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/). Each subdirectory is a self-contained project with its own controllers, world files, assets, and documentation.


Each folder includes:
- âœ… Dedicated controllers written in Python.
- âœ… Media files to visualize or demonstrate the robot.
- âœ… A `README.md` for each individual project with usage, requirements and behavior details.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- **4_wheeled_robot/**: A differential-drive robot with basic obstacle avoidance.
- *(More projects will be added as I explore new robotics tasks and sensors.)*

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) installed and configured.
- Python 3.8+ with Webots Python API enabled.

## ðŸš€ Running a Project

1. Open Webots and load the projectâ€™s world file (`.wbt`).
2. Assign the controller to the robot (usually `controller.py`).
3. Run the simulation and observe the robot behavior.
4. Refer to each projectâ€™s `README.md` for specific logic and visuals.

## ðŸ“š Resources Used

Feel free to explore each folder and run the projects in Webots. More features and robots will be added soon!
